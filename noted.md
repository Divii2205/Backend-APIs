## Client Server Architechture:

**Client**: Requests for some services
**Server**: Provides the services; does only computation, and not store; storing is done by the database
**API**: Client is ready to accept services, server is ready to provide the service and this transfer/supply of service happens through APIs. API is written/generated by the server/backend creator who generates the services.

## How backend processes requests:

Parts of url:
protocol -> domain name -> resource -> query

## Protocols: 
A set of rules and methodolagies followed during the service transfer, when API request is sent. To govern the service/data (govern the communication)

**Types:**

1. *TCP/IP* 
* Transmission Control Protocol: Controls the transmission of data; reliability and low speed
* Internet Protocol: How the transmission of data must take place

2. *HTTP/HTTPS*
* Hyper Text Transmission Protocol: Allows web communication
* Hyper Text Transmission Protocol Secure: Provides transport layer security through encryption

3. *UDP*
* User Datagram Protocol: High speed and less reliability; the TCP constantly keeps checking for errors during transmission to avoid any problems hence has a low speed and high reliability; UDP tackles this. In case some data packets are lost during transmission, send request again. Used in video calls, real time data, where user compromises on quality. 

4. *FTP*
* File Transfer Protocol: Assists in the transfer of files. 

5. *QUIC*
* Quick UDP Internet Connections: Improves the performance and security of web applications, developed by Google to replace Transmission Control Protocol 

**Netowork calls are the most expensive calls: repeated connection requests, time consuming**

# Network Protocol:

1. Data packing
2. Error handling
3. Routing
4. Flow control

NDA: Non discolsure agreement

## Streaming and SSE:

Transmitting data continuously over the internet, instead of downloading the entire file before playback
To and Fro of data packets => streaming
Client sends a request to the server, server sends request to the *storage*, server receives it and through TCP it reaches the client

# Types of streamings:

1. Progressive: Allows playback after buffering
2. Adaptive: provides option for quality
3. Real-time: Live broadcast and stock trading

**SSE**: *Server-sent Events*
Example: Push notification, when there is a change in the storage, a server sends a notification => SSE
*Unidirectional Communication*
